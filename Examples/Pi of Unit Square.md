Define the center as the point distance $\sqrt 2$ from each corner. Then, given angle $\theta$, the length of the line segment starting at the center, with angle of $\theta$ is $\sec \theta$.

Since the square is the same distances from the center on all sides, we can just consider the average radius for one side; furthermore, since the center lies on the perpendicular bisector of the sides, we can only consider half the side; the range $(0, \frac\pi2)$ rad.

To find the average radius, then, we just have to find:
$$\frac2\pi \int_0^\frac\pi2 \sec\theta d\theta$$
